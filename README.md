# Python and Pygame Simple Games Repository

This repository contains a collection of simple games created with Python and Pygame, following the concepts and projects outlined in the book "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al Sweigart.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to showcase and share various simple games developed using Python and the Pygame library. Each game is implemented as a separate project within its own folder.
